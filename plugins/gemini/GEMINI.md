# Lore Knowledge Base

Lore is a research knowledge repository available via MCP. It stores documents, meeting notes, interviews, and decisions with full citations back to original sources. Use it to ground your work in evidence and preserve important context.

## First-Time Setup

If Lore is not installed yet, you can set it up for the user.

1. **Install**: `npm install -g @getlore/cli` (requires Node.js 18+)
2. **Ask the user** for their **email address**
3. **Ask for API keys** — present these two options:
   - **Recommended**: Tell the user to run these commands themselves (keys stay out of chat history):
     ```
     export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
     export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
     ```
     Then run: `lore setup --openai-key $OPENAI_API_KEY --anthropic-key $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY --email <email> --data-dir ~/.lore`
   - **Convenient but riskier**: The user can paste keys directly into this chat and you run setup with them. Warn the user that keys shared in chat may be stored in conversation history.
4. **Send OTP**: Run the setup command — this sends a 6-digit code to their email and exits
5. **Ask the user** for the **6-digit code** from their email
6. **Complete setup**: Re-run the same command with `--code <code>` appended

After setup, Lore works autonomously.

## MCP Tools

| Tool | Cost | Use For |
|------|------|---------|
| `search` | Low | Quick lookups, finding relevant sources |
| `get_source` | Low | Full document retrieval by ID |
| `list_sources` | Low | Browse what exists in a project |
| `list_projects` | Low | Discover available knowledge domains |
| `ingest` | Low-Medium | Push content — documents, insights, or decisions |
| `research` | High | Cross-reference multiple sources, synthesize findings (supports depth: quick/standard/deep) |
| `sync` | Variable | Refresh from configured source directories |

## When to Ingest

Use `ingest` to push content into Lore when working context should be preserved, documents are shared, or you encounter important external content. Always pass `source_url` and `source_name` when available. Ingestion is idempotent.

## When to Search

Before making recommendations or answering questions about past work:
1. `search` first — it's fast and cheap. Use `since`/`before` for date filtering (e.g., `since: "7d"`). Temporal queries auto-boost recent results.
2. Only use `research` for multi-source synthesis (10x more expensive). Use `depth: "quick"` for focused questions, `"deep"` for audits.
3. Use `get_source(id, include_content: true)` for full text

For short insights or decisions, just pass the content — title and source_type are optional and auto-generated from content.
